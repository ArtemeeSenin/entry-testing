# Available tasks
Hello, here is testing round tasks for Frontend School in T-Systems.

## 1 Broken page
This nice mosaic was totally broken, please fix it.

Broken page is fixed by specifying right background positions and removing unnecessary css styles.

## 2 Maze
Help orange square get out of the frightening maze.

Unfortunately, the orange square doesn't know how to make moves up and left.
You have to teach it to do that.

JS in this task needed some mistakes fixed, like typos and wrong number.

After fixing mistakes I made an algorithm that generates the plan. Because the maze path is reversed after it's center I used two arrays and filled them with commands simultaneously.

## 4 Algorithm in JS
Fibonacci has called. Seems he canâ€™t recall his numbers, except for the first two: 1, 1.

Could you create .js file, that Fibonacci can copypaste in his browser console and get any Nth number by inputing the N into it.

In my solution the index of fibonacci number is passed from terminal arguments (let num = process.argv[2];)

For testing run  `node fibonacci-iterative.js 7` or `node fibonacci-recursive.js 5`

For iterative algorithm I used the for cycle.

[fibonacci iterative](algorithm in js/fibonacci-iterative.js)

For recursive algorithm I used recursion and ternary operator.

## How to pass
Make a fork from this repository, complete tasks and add your contact info for next communication.

And one more thing: be brave and creative :)
We are waiting for you in our team!
